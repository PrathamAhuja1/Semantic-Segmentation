Advanced Image Segmentation using Improved U-Net and SegNet Models üñºÔ∏èü§ñ
Project Overview üåç
In the rapidly advancing field of computer vision, image segmentation plays a vital role across a wide range of industries, including autonomous driving, medical imaging, geospatial analysis, and robotics. Image segmentation refers to the task of partitioning an image into meaningful segments or regions based on various features such as color, intensity, or texture. The goal is to assign each pixel in an image to a predefined class, which is essential for tasks like object detection, facial recognition, and scene understanding.


For this project, I focused on exploring and implementing two powerful architectures‚ÄîImproved U-Net and SegNet‚Äîto perform pixel-level classification on high-resolution images. These models are at the forefront of semantic segmentation and offer great flexibility and accuracy when applied to real-world image data. This project presents an in-depth approach to developing, training, and evaluating these models on a semantic segmentation task, utilizing a robust dataset for training, implementing custom loss functions, and evaluating the performance of the models using key metrics.
