🚀 New Project: Image Segmentation with Deep Learning 🌐

Project Overview:
This project focuses on implementing and comparing different deep learning models for image segmentation. Specifically, I developed custom U-Net and SegNet models to segment images into meaningful parts based on pixel-level predictions.

Key Highlights:

  🔹 Improved U-Net Model:
         The model focuses on precise segmentation using an architecture that includes an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections for better feature extraction.

  🔹 SegNet Model:
        A fully convolutional network architecture specifically designed for image segmentation tasks. It uses max-pooling indices to help reconstruct high-resolution output.

  🔹 Training & Optimization:
        Both models were trained on custom datasets, and I implemented optimization techniques to boost the performance and generalization of these models. The Adam optimizer and Cross-Entropy loss function were 
        used to train the networks efficiently.

 🔹 Evaluation:
       I used various metrics such as IoU (Intersection over Union) and Dice Coefficient to evaluate the models' performance. The results were promising, with improvements in segmentation accuracy over baseline 
       models.

 🔹 Tools & Technologies:

  Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib

  Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub

  Environment: Cloud-based GPUs for training


Next Steps:
   I plan to refine the models further by exploring advanced architectures like Mask R-CNN and DeepLabV3+. The goal is to achieve more robust segmentation performance and generalize better to different datasets.
